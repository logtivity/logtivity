Track activity/events on your website. Connect your site to Logtivity to send logs to the third party service for metrics and security purposes.

== Description ==

Logtivity is a Dedicated Event Monitoring Solution for WordPress. This plugin will capture events/actions on a WP site and send them to Logtivity for logging, reporting and checking for alerts. Some actions this plugin will track include installing/updating plugins, creating, updating and deleting users, page/post/custom post type CRUD actions and more.

Logtivity allows you to store all your sites logs in one place, set up alerts for key actions you may wish to be notified of, keep a papertrail of actions taking place on your website, export and create reports on to view the events more visually using charts.

`
Logtivity::log()
	->setAction('My Custom Action')
	->addMeta('Meta Label', $meta)

	->addUserMeta('Stripe Customer ID', $stripeCustomerId)
	->send();
`

= Can I disable user information being sent with the logs =

Yes. You can choose to only log a profile link, user ID, username, IP address, or nothing at all.

= Can I disable all default logging and only store custom logs. =

Yes! You can easily disable all default logging that this plugin provides so that you can only store the logs that matter to you manually.

You can also disable buit in logs on an individual basis via the filter example below:

`
add_action('wp_logtivity_instance', function($Logtivity_Logger) {

	if (strpos($Logtivity_Logger->action, 'Page was updated') !== false) {
		$Logtivity_Logger->stop();
	}

});
